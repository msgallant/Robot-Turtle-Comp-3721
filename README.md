# Robot-Turtle-Comp-3721

This is a university partner assignment. It is a kids game where you can have a maximum of 4 players. You can place stone walls, ice walls, crates or portals anywhere
on the board. If a turtle (a player) runs into a stone wall then it cannot move forward. It blocks the way. Same with ice wall except if the turtle plays the laser card
facing the ice wall which will destroy the ice wall. If a turtle runs into a crate then the turtle will move forward and push the crate forward too. If the turtle goes 
onto a portal then the turtle will teleport to the other portal. If the turtle goes on a jewel then the player wins the game. You must set up a program which will
be a series of cards like move forward, turn left, laser, etc. It must lead the turtle from its starting point to the jewel in one turn. If you do not get to the
jewel then you must play the bug card which resets your position to the beginning. If you set up the function frog card by confirming two move forwards then
when you set up the program and play the function frog card it registers as two move forward cards.
